## How to host

Here is a guide: [How to deploy the project](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/SparkMate_Dating_App/blob/main/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.MD)

## My process

### Built with

- React Native
- Expo Router
- Socket.IO
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

Developing SparkMate provided deep insights into integrating real-time features with Socket.IO and managing large-scale user interactions efficiently using MongoDB. This project also enhanced my skills in React Native and cross-platform mobile app development.

### Continued development

I plan to further optimize the real-time features, introduce new interactive elements, and explore advanced algorithms to improve match-making accuracy and user engagement.
